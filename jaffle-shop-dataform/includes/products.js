The dbt Jinja macro you provided is actually a very simple dbt model definition, not a complex macro that takes arguments. It just defines a CTE and selects from it, which boils down to selecting directly from `stg_products`.

Here's how you'd convert that into a Dataform JavaScript function (which would live in a `.js` file in your Dataform project):

**dbt Jinja (your input):**

```sql
-- models/my_new_products_model.sql (example filename for dbt)

with

products as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_products') }}

)

select * from products
```

**Dataform JavaScript function:**

You would create a file like `definitions/my_new_products_model.js` (or any other path under `definitions/`).

```javascript
// definitions/my_new_products_model.js

// This defines a Dataform table named 'my_new_products_model'.
// The 'ctx' object provides functions like 'ref' to reference other Dataform models/tables.
table("my_new_products_model").query(ctx => `
    select * from ${ctx.ref("stg_products")}
`);

// If you prefer it to be a view, you'd use:
/*
view("my_new_products_model").query(ctx => `
    select * from ${ctx.ref("stg_products")}
`);
*/
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`table("my_new_products_model")`**: This is the Dataform way to declare that you are defining a new table (or view) in your data warehouse. The string `"my_new_products_model"` will be the name of the table/view created by Dataform.
2.  **`.query(ctx => \`...\` )`**: This method defines the SQL query that will populate your table/view.
    *   `ctx` is a context object provided by Dataform to JavaScript functions. It contains useful methods and properties, such as `ctx.ref()`, `ctx.source()`, `ctx.database`, `ctx.schema`, etc.
    *   The backticks `` `...` `` define a JavaScript template literal, which allows for multiline strings and embedded expressions (like `${ctx.ref("stg_products")}`).
3.  **`${ctx.ref("stg_products")}`**: This is the Dataform equivalent of dbt's `{{ ref('stg_products') }}`. It tells Dataform to resolve the fully qualified name of the `stg_products` model/table and insert it into the SQL query.

This Dataform JavaScript function achieves the exact same outcome as your dbt SQL model: it creates a new table or view named `my_new_products_model` that contains all columns and rows from `stg_products`.
