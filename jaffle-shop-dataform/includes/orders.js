You're asking to convert a dbt SQL model (which happens to use Jinja's `ref`) into a Dataform model defined using Dataform's JavaScript API.

The core of the dbt model is its SQL logic, which we'll embed directly into a Dataform `dataform.sql()` definition. The `{{ ref(...) }}` calls will be replaced with Dataform's `ctx.ref(...)` syntax within a JavaScript template literal.

Here's the Dataform JavaScript equivalent:

**File: `models/orders_enriched.js`** (or `orders_enriched.sqlx` if you prefer SQLX, but this is the JS function version)

```javascript
dataform.sql("orders_enriched", (ctx) => `

    with

    orders as (

        select * from ${ctx.ref('stg_orders')}

    ),

    order_items as (

        select * from ${ctx.ref('order_items')}

    ),

    order_items_summary as (

        select
            order_id,

            sum(supply_cost) as order_cost,
            sum(product_price) as order_items_subtotal,
            count(order_item_id) as count_order_items,
            sum(
                case
                    when is_food_item then 1
                    else 0
                end
            ) as count_food_items,
            sum(
                case
                    when is_drink_item then 1
                    else 0
                end
            ) as count_drink_items

        from order_items -- This refers to the CTE 'order_items' defined above

        group by 1

    ),

    compute_booleans as (

        select
            orders.*,

            order_items_summary.order_cost,
            order_items_summary.order_items_subtotal,
            order_items_summary.count_food_items,
            order_items_summary.count_drink_items,
            order_items_summary.count_order_items,
            order_items_summary.count_food_items > 0 as is_food_order,
            order_items_summary.count_drink_items > 0 as is_drink_order

        from orders -- This refers to the CTE 'orders' defined above

        left join
            order_items_summary
            on orders.order_id = order_items_summary.order_id

    ),

    customer_order_count as (

        select
            *,

            row_number() over (
                partition by customer_id
                order by ordered_at asc
            ) as customer_order_number

        from compute_booleans

    )

    select * from customer_order_count

`)
// Optional: Add configuration for your model
.config({
    type: "table", // or "view"
    schema: "analytics", // Replace with your target schema
    description: "Enriched orders data with aggregated item details and customer order number."
});
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **`dataform.sql("orders_enriched", (ctx) => ...)`**: This is the standard Dataform JavaScript API to define a SQL model.
    *   `"orders_enriched"`: This is the name of your Dataform model, which will typically become the table/view name in your data warehouse (unless overridden in `config`).
    *   `(ctx) => ...`: This is a JavaScript arrow function that receives a `context` object (`ctx`).
2.  **Backticks `` `...` ``**: The entire SQL query is enclosed within backticks, creating a JavaScript template literal. This allows for multi-line strings and easy embedding of JavaScript expressions.
3.  **`${ctx.ref('model_name')}`**: This replaces the dbt `{{ ref('model_name') }}`.
    *   `ctx.ref()` is Dataform's equivalent for referencing other models within your project. Dataform automatically handles dependencies based on these calls.
4.  **`config({})`**: This is where you set optional configurations for your model, such as:
    *   `type`: Whether to build a `"table"` (materialized) or a `("view")` (virtual). The default is `"view"`.
    *   `schema`: The target schema in your data warehouse where this model will be created.
    *   `description`: A human-readable description for your model.

This Dataform JavaScript function directly translates the dbt model's logic, making it executable within a Dataform project.
