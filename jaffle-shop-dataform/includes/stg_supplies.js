Okay, let's convert that dbt Jinja macro into a Dataform JavaScript function.

**Assumptions:**

1.  **`source('ecom', 'raw_supplies')`**: In dbt, this typically refers to an external table declared in your `sources.yml`. In Dataform, you'll need to `declare` this external table first.
2.  **`dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['id', 'sku'])`**: This macro usually generates a hash (like MD5 or SHA256) of the concatenated values. We'll replicate this directly in SQL using `MD5(CONCAT(...))`.
3.  **`cents_to_dollars('cost')`**: This is a custom macro that likely performs `cost / 100.0`. We'll implement this directly.
4.  **Output**: We'll create a Dataform `view` for the transformed data, similar to how dbt models often create views by default.

### Step 1: Declare the External Source (if `ecom.raw_supplies` is an external table)

Create a new file, for example, `definitions/sources.js`:

```javascript
// definitions/sources.js
dataform.project("your-gcp-project-id") // Replace with your actual GCP Project ID
  .declare({
    name: "raw_supplies",
    schema: "ecom" // Or dataset in BigQuery terminology
  });
```

*   **`your-gcp-project-id`**: Replace this with the actual GCP Project ID where your `ecom.raw_supplies` table resides.
*   **`schema: "ecom"`**: If `ecom` is a BigQuery dataset name, this is correct. If it's a different database/schema structure, adjust accordingly.

---

### Step 2: Create the Dataform JavaScript File

Now, create your main Dataform file, e.g., `models/supply_transformations.js`:

```javascript
// models/supply_transformations.js
dataform.project("your-gcp-project-id") // Replace with your actual GCP Project ID
  .view("supplies_transformed") // This will be the name of your new view/table
  .query(ctx => {
    // Reference the declared external source
    const sourceTable = ctx.ref("raw_supplies");

    return `
      SELECT
        -- IDs
        -- Equivalent of dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['id', 'sku'])
        -- We're using MD5 for hashing and concatenating id and sku as strings.
        MD5(CONCAT(CAST(id AS STRING), CAST(sku AS STRING))) AS supply_uuid,
        id AS supply_id,
        sku AS product_id,

        -- Text
        name AS supply_name,

        -- Numerics
        -- Equivalent of cents_to_dollars('cost')
        cost / 100.0 AS supply_cost,

        -- Booleans
        perishable AS is_perishable_supply

      FROM
        ${sourceTable}
    `;
  });
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1.  **`dataform.project("your-gcp-project-id").view("supplies_transformed")`**:
    *   `dataform.project("...")`: Every Dataform file starts by associating itself with your project.
    *   `.view("supplies_transformed")`: We define this output as a SQL `VIEW` named `supplies_transformed`. You could use `.table()` if you want a persistent table instead.
2.  **`.query(ctx => { ... });`**:
    *   This is where your SQL query lives. The `ctx` object provides helper functions.
3.  **`const sourceTable = ctx.ref("raw_supplies");`**:
    *   `ctx.ref()` is Dataform's way of referencing other tables or views defined within Dataform, including declared external sources. This is equivalent to dbt's `{{ ref('my_model') }}` or `{{ source('schema', 'table') }}` after the source is declared.
4.  **SQL Logic (`MD5(CONCAT(...))` and `cost / 100.0`)**:
    *   Since Dataform directly uses SQL, you embed the equivalent SQL functions and arithmetic operations directly into your query string. There's no need for special Jinja macros here.
    *   `MD5(CONCAT(CAST(id AS STRING), CAST(sku AS STRING)))`: This is the standard SQL way to achieve a surrogate key by concatenating and hashing two columns. `CAST(... AS STRING)` is important to ensure proper string concatenation before hashing.
    *   `cost / 100.0`: Directly performs the division for cents to dollars.
5.  **Template Literals (` `` `)**:
    *   The backticks (` `` `) allow for multi-line strings and easy embedding of JavaScript variables (`${sourceTable}`) directly into the SQL query string.

Now, when you run this Dataform project, it will create a view named `supplies_transformed` in your specified BigQuery dataset (or other data warehouse) with the transformed data.
