Here's how you can convert that dbt Jinja macro into a Dataform JavaScript function.

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **File Structure:** Dataform models are defined in `.js` files.
2.  **`publish()` Function:** This is the core Dataform function to define a table or view.
    *   The first argument (`"stg_ecom_items"`) is the name of the resulting table/view in your BigQuery dataset.
    *   The second argument (an object `{ type: "view", ... }`) defines properties like the materialization type (`"view"` or `"table"`), description, etc.
3.  **`.query(ctx => ``)`:** This method defines the SQL query itself.
    *   We use a JavaScript template literal (backticks `` ` ``) for multiline SQL.
    *   `ctx` is the context object, which provides functions like `source()`, `ref()`, and `self()`.
4.  **`source('ecom', 'raw_items')` to `${source("ecom", "raw_items")}`:**
    *   In dbt, `{{ source(...) }}` directly renders the table name.
    *   In Dataform, `source("ecom", "raw_items")` is a JavaScript function call that returns the fully qualified table name. We embed this JavaScript call directly into the SQL string using `${}` (template literal interpolation).

**Dataform JavaScript File (e.g., `definitions/stg_ecom_items.js`)**

```javascript
/**
 * This model stages the raw e-commerce items,
 * renaming key identifiers for clarity and consistency.
 */
publish("stg_ecom_items", {
  type: "view", // Use "table" if you want to materialize it as a physical table
  description: "Staging model for e-commerce raw items, renaming IDs.",
  columns: {
    order_item_id: "Unique identifier for each item within an order.",
    order_id: "The ID of the order this item belongs to.",
    product_id: "The SKU (stock keeping unit) representing the product ID."
  }
}).query(ctx => `
  with source as (
    select * from ${source("ecom", "raw_items")}
  ),

  renamed as (
    select
      id as order_item_id,
      order_id,
      sku as product_id
    from source
  )

  select * from renamed
`);
```

**How to use it:**

1.  Save the above code in your Dataform project, typically in a `definitions/` folder, as a `.js` file (e.g., `stg_ecom_items.js`).
2.  Ensure you have a `source` declaration for `ecom.raw_items` in your Dataform project (e.g., in a `declarations/` folder):

    ```javascript
    // declarations/ecom.js
    declare({
      schema: "ecom", // Replace with your actual dataset name
      name: "raw_items"
    });
    ```

Now, when you compile and run your Dataform project, `stg_ecom_items` will be created as a view in your target BigQuery dataset, based on the `raw_items` table.
