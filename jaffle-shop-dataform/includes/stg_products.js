To convert your dbt Jinja macro (which appears to be a full dbt model definition) into a Dataform JavaScript function, we'll use Dataform's `dataset` function and embed the SQL query within backticks.

**Assumption:**
The dbt macro `{{ cents_to_dollars('price') }}` is assumed to translate to `price / 100.0` in SQL, which is a common implementation for converting cents to dollars. If your `cents_to_dollars` macro has a different logic, you'll need to replace `price / 100.0` with its actual SQL definition.

Here's the Dataform JavaScript equivalent:

```javascript
// File: definitions/products.js (or similar name in your Dataform project)

/**
 * @file This model transforms raw product data into a cleaned format,
 *       calculating product prices in dollars and flagging item types.
 */
dataset("products", {
  // Optional: Configure your dataset (table or view, schema, description, etc.)
  // type: "table", // 'table' is the default. Use 'view' for a view.
  // schema: "analytics", // Specify the schema if different from project default
  description: "Transformed product data including price in dollars and item categories.",
  tags: ["ecom", "products"], // Add relevant tags for organization
})
.query(() => {
  return `
    with

    source as (

        select * from ${source('ecom', 'raw_products')}

    ),

    renamed as (

        select

            ----------  ids
            sku as product_id,

            ---------- text
            name as product_name,
            type as product_type,
            description as product_description,


            ---------- numerics
            -- Assuming 'cents_to_dollars' macro converts cents to dollars by dividing by 100.0
            price / 100.0 as product_price,

            ---------- booleans
            coalesce(type = 'jaffle', false) as is_food_item,

            coalesce(type = 'beverage', false) as is_drink_item

        from source

    )

    select * from renamed
  `;
});
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **`dataset("products", { ... })`**:
    *   This is the core Dataform function that defines a new table or view. `"products"` will be the name of the resulting table/view in your data warehouse.
    *   The second argument is an optional configuration object where you can specify `type` (e.g., `"table"` or `"view"`), `schema`, `description`, `tags`, etc.

2.  **`.query(() => { return \`...\`; })`**:
    *   This defines the SQL query that will populate your dataset.
    *   The SQL is enclosed within **backticks** (`` ` ``). This allows for multi-line strings and easy interpolation of JavaScript variables and functions.

3.  **`source('ecom', 'raw_products')`**:
    *   In dbt, you use `{{ source('ecom', 'raw_products') }}`.
    *   In Dataform, you use `${source('ecom', 'raw_products')}`. The `${}` syntax is JavaScript's template literal interpolation, and `source()` is a built-in Dataform function to reference declared sources.

4.  **`price / 100.0 as product_price`**:
    *   This replaces `{{ cents_to_dollars('price') }}`. As mentioned in the assumption, this is the most common SQL translation for such a macro.

All other SQL syntax (CTEs, column aliases, `coalesce` function, boolean comparisons) remains the same as standard SQL.
