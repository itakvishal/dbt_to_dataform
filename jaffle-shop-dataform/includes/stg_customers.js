Okay, let's convert that dbt model into a Dataform JavaScript function.

First, a note: The dbt code you provided is a dbt *model* (a `*.sql` file), not a dbt *macro* (which would be defined in a `*.sql` file in the `macros` directory and invoked with `{{ my_macro() }}`). This distinction is important because Dataform's direct equivalent for a dbt model is a `table` or `view` definition, while a dbt macro might translate to a Dataform user-defined function (UDF) or a reusable `operations` script, or sometimes even just a JavaScript helper function.

Assuming you want to create a Dataform table/view that produces the same output as your dbt model:

**1. Prerequisite: Define your external source in Dataform**

Just like dbt needs `sources.yml`, Dataform needs to know about your external tables. Create a file named `definitions/sources.js` (if you don't have one) and define your `ecom` source and `raw_customers` table.

```javascript
// definitions/sources.js
source("ecom", "raw_customers")
  .database("your-gcp-project-id") // Replace with your GCP project ID
  .schema("your_dataset_name")    // Replace with the BigQuery dataset where raw_customers lives
  .tableName("raw_customers");     // The actual table name in BigQuery
```
*Note: The `database`, `schema`, and `tableName` should match your BigQuery setup.*

**2. Dataform JavaScript Function (Table Definition)**

Now, create a new file in your Dataform project (e.g., `definitions/customers.js`) and add the following:

```javascript
// definitions/customers.js
table("customers") // This will create a table/view named 'customers' in your BigQuery dataset
  .description("Customers derived from raw_customers, with renamed IDs and names.")
  .columns({
    customer_id: "Unique identifier for the customer.",
    customer_name: "The full name of the customer."
  })
  .query(() => sql`
    WITH source AS (
      SELECT * FROM ${source("ecom", "raw_customers")}
    ),

    renamed AS (
      SELECT
        -- ids
        id AS customer_id,

        -- text
        name AS customer_name
      FROM source
    )

    SELECT * FROM renamed
  `);
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **`table("customers")`**: This defines a new Dataform table (or view, if you used `view("customers")`) named `customers`. This will be the name of the resulting table in your BigQuery project.
*   **`.description(...)` and `.columns(...)`**: These are Dataform features for adding metadata to your table and its columns, which is very useful for documentation and discoverability in BigQuery and Dataform's UI.
*   **`.query(() => sql`...`)`**: This is where you put your SQL logic.
    *   The `sql` template literal tag (from `@dataform/core`) allows you to embed JavaScript expressions directly into your SQL.
    *   **`FROM ${source("ecom", "raw_customers")}`**: This is the key translation.
        *   DBT's `{{ source('ecom', 'raw_customers') }}` is replaced by Dataform's JavaScript function `source("ecom", "raw_customers")`.
        *   Dataform will resolve this to the fully qualified table reference defined in `definitions/sources.js` (e.g., ``your-gcp-project-id.your_dataset_name.raw_customers``) before executing the query.
*   **SQL Logic**: The `WITH` CTEs and `SELECT` statements remain largely identical as they are standard SQL.

This Dataform definition will create a `customers` table (or view) in your BigQuery environment, containing `customer_id` and `customer_name` columns derived from your `raw_customers` source.
